            "5. Can you describe the concept of \"virtual DOM\" in ReactJS? State management libraries like Redux and MobX provide predictable ways of managing complex states.\n",
            "6. Have you worked with class-based components as well as functional components? If so, can you discuss their differences and use cases? Server-side rendering (SSR) speeds up loading times and enhances SEO friendliness. With frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby\n",
            "7. How would you manage application data that needs to be shared between multiple components in a large-scale React app? Form validation can be handled using third-party packages like Formik and Yup, or custom event handlers\n",
            "8. Can you walk me through an example of using hooks in a React component? Code splitting is achieved via dynamic imports in React\n",
            "9. Have you ever had to optimize performance in a React application? If so, what techniques did you use? Debugging a React application typically includes using developer console for logging variables, inspecting element structure, analyzing performance bottlenecks\n",

            "11. Have you integrated third-party libraries into your React projects before? Could you provide an example? Class components derive functionality from ES6 classes extending React.Component, whereas functional components rely solely on functions taking 'props' arguments. Functional components are preferred due to simpler syntax and improved performance since Hooks were introduced\n",
            "12. How have you handled form validation and submission in React applications?  Yes, I have used several hooks including useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, and useMemo. Each serves different purposes; e.g., useState manages local component state,\n",
            "13. Can you describe your experience testing React applications? Which tools have you used for unit tests and end-to-end tests? Context API provides a way to pass data between nested components without having to manually pass props through every level.\n",
            "14. Have you implemented any server-side rendering (SSR) solutions with React? If yes, then which one(s)? Accessibility best practices involve following WAI-ARIA standards, adding semantic HTML tags, ensuring proper keyboard navigation, utilizing high contrast colors\n",
            "15. Can you explain the difference between controlled vs uncontrolled components in React? When would you choose one over the other?\"\"\"  During a previous project, we encountered slow rendering issues caused by excessive deep nesting of components.\n",
